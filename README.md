# Stock Predictor Project 📈

### By Abdelrahman Mohamed

I am Abdelrahman Mohamed, a data analyst and passionate data scientist from Egypt, currently in Prep 3. I graduated from the ALX Data Science program, where I honed my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and Python development. This project reflects my interest in applying data science to financial markets by building a stock market analysis and prediction tool.

## 📊 Project Overview

The **Stock Predictor Project** is a Python-based tool designed for analyzing and predicting stock market trends. With this project, users can retrieve real-time stock data, calculate volatility, compare stocks, and visualize stock performance over time. The tool is built with a focus on simplicity, allowing anyone to perform insightful analyses with just a few inputs.

### 🚀 Key Features

- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Pull historical data for any stock listed on major exchanges using the `yfinance` library.
- **Volatility Calculation**: Evaluate a stock's volatility over a 6-month period to assess potential risks.
- **Stock Comparison**: Compare the performance of two different stocks over a user-defined time frame.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear and intuitive price trends plotted using `matplotlib`, helping users to visualize stock movements and trends.
- **Customizable Time Frames**: Analyze stock performance for the last 30, 60, or 90 days, depending on user preference.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for building the application.
- **yFinance**: API for fetching real-time stock data.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing stock data with plots and charts.
- **Pandas**: For handling and processing data efficiently.

## 📘 How to Use the Stock Predictor

Once the app is running, follow the on-screen prompts to perform various analyses.

### Key Actions:

1. **Fetch Stock Data**: Enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, TSLA), and choose the time frame (e.g., 30, 60, or 90 days) to retrieve stock price data.
   
2. **Volatility Calculation**: Opt to calculate the stock's volatility over the last 6 months to understand its risk profile.

3. **Compare Two Stocks**: Enter the ticker symbols of two stocks to compare their price performance side by side.

4. **Visualize Stock Trends**: View the stock performance over time through detailed plots.

## 🌱 Future Enhancements

Here are some features planned for future development:

- **Technical Indicators**: Adding moving averages, RSI, and other technical indicators for in-depth analysis.
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing stock price prediction using machine learning algorithms.
- **User Interface**: Building a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance usability.
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Allow users to track and analyze their stock portfolios.
